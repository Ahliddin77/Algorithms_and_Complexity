# Algorithms_and_Complexity
In this project, we investigate a classical problem: sorting. The problem is to
arrange an array of n integers according to some total order which is
computed in O(1). Our total order is going to be an ascending order. In this
paper we compare four comparison-based sorting algorithms: insertion sort,
quicksort, heapsort and mergesort. After that, based on the comparison, we
write a hybrid sorting algorithm which combines the best parts of the all
researched algorithms.
